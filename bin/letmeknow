letmeknow

notify about completed comnmands or changes to system state. 

Run this command if you want to look away from your terminal for a while, 
waiting for a process to complete. Without any arguments it will notify 
when the previous command completes, optionally emailing the user. Make 
sure to use a ~/.forward file, because the mail is sent to the logged in user. 

There are also several convenient shortcuts for checking on state changes: 

    - check for internet 
    - watch for a host to come online 
    - command completes


Usage: 
    letmeknow --by window          # display an X11 window
    letmeknow --by systemtray      # use desktop environment's notification tray
    letmeknow --by email           # send email to current user
    letmeknow --by audio           # make a noise to alert the user 
    letmeknow --message            # declare custom message to display;
    letmeknow --help               # show this usage information

Supported options:

    -h, --help                  # show this usage information
    -v, --verbose               # enable chatty output
